      <h2>Hello! 👋🏽 My name is Cesar Fuentes.</h2>

      <br><br>

      📍 Dallas, Texas <br><br>

      🎓 Working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science<br><br>

      <!-- 🏙 Dallas native with a passion for creating applications that help people in need <br><br> -->

      <!-- 📚 I work as a calculus tutor for college and high school students with Tutor.com, and I have gained valuable skills in communication and problem-solving. I also serve as the Vice President of TAMU UNICEF, which has taught me to be selfless and intentional with my actions, two qualities that have changed the direction of my professional career. With these experiences, I have gained a perspective that will give meaning to my degree, and in the following years, I will be sharpening my programming skills to realize my dream. <br><br> -->

      💻 Working as a software engineer on a diverse team to solve pressing issues and bring people together. <br><br>

      <!-- 💪🏽 I am constantly thinking of ideas that can improve the businesses and the lives of others. I pride myself in honoring my commitments and fully considering every option before committing to decisions. No matter what I do, I can also find a way to tie my passions into my work. <br><br> -->
